# landing-page

This is the landing page README file for Manx3P

## What is the Manx3P?

DESCRIBE IT

## Getting Started

You will probably need some devops help getting set up to run this landing page.

## The folder structure

The folder structure for this project should be:

```
landing-page
  |-api
    |-src
      |-service
  |-app
    |-src
      |-component
      |-service
```

You can see that the application is first divided into two main domains, the `api` and the `app`. Both of these contain a `service` folder. The `app` also contains a `component` folder. It is
important that you structure your stack application in this way, using these names.
